# Workout Tracker
An app to create and track daily workouts and view charts displaying workout data using Express, Mongo and Mongoose.

Users can add exercises and data for those exercises (including names, reps, sets, weights, distance and duration) to a workout database. Upon opening the app, they can either continue their most recent workout or start a new one. By clicking the "Fitness Tracker Dashboard" link in the navbar, the user can view a "stats" page with charts illustrating their progress.
